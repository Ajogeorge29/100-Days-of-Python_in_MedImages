# 100 Days of Python in Medical Imaging

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python in Medical Imaging** repository! This is a coding challenge where Iâ€™ll be working on Python projects related to medical imaging and AI diagnostics for 100 consecutive days.

## Goals
- Learn and apply Python for medical imaging tasks.
- Explore AI and machine learning techniques for diagnostics.
- Build a portfolio of projects using open-source datasets.

## Projects
### Day 1: Loading and Visualizing Medical Images
- **Description**: Loaded and visualized chest X-ray images from the PneumoniaMNIST dataset.
- **Files**:
  - `day1.py`: Python script to load and visualize the dataset.
  - `sample_chest_xray.png`: Sample chest X-ray image saved from the dataset.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install medmnist matplotlib numpy
     ```

### Day 2: Image Preprocessing
- **Description**: Applied image preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to the ChestMNIST dataset.
- **Files**:
  - `day2.py`: Python script for image preprocessing.
  - `resized_chest_xray.png`: Resized chest X-ray image.
  - `augmented_chest_xray.png`: Augmented chest X-ray image.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install medmnist matplotlib numpy torch torchvision
     ```
  2. Run the script:
     ```bash
     python day2.py
     ```

## How to Use This Repository
- Each dayâ€™s project will be added to a separate folder (e.g., `Day1_Loading_and_Visualizing_Medical_Images`).
- The `README.md` file in each folder will contain details about the project, including how to run the code.
